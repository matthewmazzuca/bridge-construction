This repertory is used to store bash scripts for generating 
feelpp pre-requisites

It also is used for creating the modules stored in $HOME/modules
following what is done in feepp.config (see on github)

Each time a pre-requisite is built DO NOT forget :
* to add the corresponding file in feelpp.config/modules/files/CATEGORIES/*.feelpp 
* to load the module and/or add an environment variable in feelpp.config/etc/feelpprc.d/froggy.sh

NOTES:
freeride: contains old stuff made during freeride
