# Create here the python lines to define the implementation of the function

# In order to be able to use that function with the openturns library, it is necessary to define aclass which derives from OpenTURNSPythonFunction

class modelePYTHON(OpenTURNSPythonFunction):
# That following method defines the input size (5) and the output size(7): This implementation is for the parametrized FEM (PFEM)
        def __init__(self):
          OpenTURNSPythonFunction.__init__(self, 5, 7)
# That following method gives the implementation of modelePYTHON
        def f(self,X):
	  v = []
	  for i in range(len(X)):
	    v.append(X[i])
	  v.append(1.) # meshsize times 1e-3 (default: 1)
	  v.append(2) # integer : polynomial degree for the temperature in {1,2,3,4} (default: 2)
	  return v

# Use that function defined in the script python with the openturns library
# Create a NumericalMathFunction from modelePYTHON
 
# Load monolithic fem implementation
