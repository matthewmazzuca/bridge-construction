  \subsection assertions Assertions

  Feel defines a few macros to test pre and post conditions. To
  enable them all you define the preprocessing variable \c
  FEELPP_CHECK_ALL . This is done easily by configuring Feel with the
  flag \c --enable-debug which will include the option
  \c -DFEELPP_CHECK_ALL
