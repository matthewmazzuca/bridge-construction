    abstract = {{A new framework for two-fluids flow using a Finite Element/Level Set method is presented and verified through the simulation of the rising of a bubble in a viscous fluid. This model is then enriched to deal with vesicles (which mimic red blood cells mechanical behavior) by introducing a Lagrange multiplier to constrain the inextensibility of the membrane. Moreover, high order polynomial approximation is used to increase the accuracy of the simulations. A validation of this model is finally presented on known behaviors of vesicles under flow such as ''tank treading'' and tumbling motions.}},

    abstract = {{This paper addresses the numerical approximation of Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) problems through the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework, high order methods and a Dirichlet-Newmann approach for the coupling. The paper is divided in two main parts. The first part concerns the discretization method for the FSI problem. We introduce an improved ALE map, capable of handling curved geometries in 2D and 3D in an unified manner, that is based on a local differential operator. We also propose a minimal CIP stabilization term for the fluid discretization that accounts for a smaller computational effort, while stabilizing the flow regime. The second part is dedicated to validate our numerical strategy through a benchmark and some applications to blood flow in arteries.}},

The first part provides a digression through the design of the library as well as the main abstractions handled by it, namely, meshes, function spaces, operators, linear and bilinear forms and an embedded variational language. In every case, the closeness between the language developed in \Feel and the equivalent mathematical objects is highlighted. In the second part, examples using the mortar, Schwartz (non)overlapping, three fields and two ficticious domain-like methods (the Fat Boundary Method and the Penalty Method) are presented and numerically solved in the scope of the library.}},
