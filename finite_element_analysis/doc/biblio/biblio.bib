	integration and ongoing support of mathematical software libraries
	within an object-oriented framework for the solution of large-scale,
	complex multi-physics engineering and scienti c problems. Trilinos
	addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these
	problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and set of tools for
	development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting
	interoperability of independently developed software. \par Trilinos
	uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of
	packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed
	by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as
	algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist
	underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel,
	including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking.
	\par Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our
	use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations.
	We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package
	and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate
	how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally,
	we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality software engineering
	practices that are increasingly required from simulation software.},

	A simple example that generates factorials at compile time is presented.
	Although this technique might seem like just a cute C++ trick, it
	becomes powerful when combined with normal C++ code. In this hybrid
	approach, source code contains two programs: the normal C++ runtime
	program, and a template metaprogram that runs at compile time. Template
	metaprograms can generate useful code when interpreted by the compiler,
	such as a massively inlined algorithm-that is, an implementation
	of an algorithm that works for a specific input size, and has its
	loops unrolled. This results in large speed increases for many applications.
	The article presents a simple template metaprogram that generates
	a bubble sort algorithm and its performance is analysed.},

    abstract = {{In this work we propose an original implementation of a large family of lowest-order methods for diffusive problems including standard and hybrid finite volume methods, mimetic finite difference-type schemes, and cell centered Galerkin methods. The key idea is to regard the method at hand as a (Petrov-)Galerkin scheme based on possibly incomplete, broken affine spaces defined from a gradient reconstruction and a point value. The resulting unified framework serves as a basis for the development of a FreeFEM-like domain specific embedded language targeted at defining discrete linear and bilinear forms. Both the back-end and the front-end of the language are extensively discussed, and several examples of applications are provided. The overhead of the language is evaluated by comparing with a more traditional implementation. A benchmark including the comparison with more classical finite element methods on standard meshes is also proposed.}},
