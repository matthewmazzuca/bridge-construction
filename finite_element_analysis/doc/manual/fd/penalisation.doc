    \section FictitiousDomainPenalisationParticle_Intro Introduction

    We propose a somewhat simple numerical method albeit used
    conjointly with physical experiments to understand particle flows
    in capillaries.  Studies of flows in micro channels have been
    multiplied since several years because of the goal to create cheap
    and efficient lab-on-chips. An application that would like to
    achieve many groups with a good quality is the sorting of
    particles on lab-on-chips. For example sorting healthy / sick red
    blood cells. One of the building blocs of such microfluidic system
    is the splitting of a channel into two daughters channels. All the
    mechanisms involving the spreading of particles in such a system
    are not completely understood. It has been seen for example that,
    when a suspension of particles pass through a bifurcation having
    different flow rates at outlet, the branch having the higher flow
    rate see its volume fraction (concentration of particles)
    increase. This phenomenon is known as the \textit{Zweifach - Fung
    effect} \cite{YuanCheng197334}.

    In \cite DOYEUX2011a, the authors used \c FreeFem++ to run a 2D
    simulation of a microfluidic bifurcation in which a rigid and circular particle
    is put in the inlet channel and goes to one of the outlet channels. The choice
    of the particle to go to the higher or the lower flow rate channel depends on many
    parameters which have been studied in the paper such as the flow rate ratio
    between the two branches, the size of the particle, the size of the outlet
    channels or even the angle between the inlet and the outlet channels. The
    simulations were compared with experiments and showed a good agreement. These
    simulations and experiments shown an attracting hydrodynamical force toward the
    lower flow rate channel which was unknown until there. Moreover the increase in
    concentration in the highest flow rate branch has been explained by a
    geometrical effect of the distribution of particles in the inlet channel which
    was a good step forward in the understanding of the \e Zweifach-Fung \c effect.

    \section FictitiousDomainPenalisationParticle_Model Model and numerical method

    We propose to implement the method used in \cite DOYEUX2011a and have both 2D
    and 3D setups which is readily the case using \c Feel++. Moreover, \c Feel++
    allows us to run the same simulation in 3D without re-coding.

    The size of the channel is very small (typically
    \f$\unit{60}{\micro\meter}\f$), so that we can assume that we are in a low Reynolds
    number regime  (\f$Re=10^{-1}\f$ in \cite DOYEUX2011a). The particles are rigid
    and spherical (circular in 2D) and for the sake of simplicity, we consider only one
    particle in the bifurcation. The extension  to many particles can be done
    with no special care since the particles do not touch. This assumption is valid
    since we are interested in dilute suspension and in this case the hydrodynamic
    force is generally sufficient to prevent contacts.


    Let's call \f$\Omega_f\f$ the fluid domain, \f$B\f$ the particle domain and \f$\Omega = \Omega_f \cup
    B\f$ the whole domain. As explained above, the fluid is assumed to be governed by Stokes equations

    \f{eqnarray}{
    - 2 \nu \nabla \cdot \bm{D(u)} + \nabla p &=& 0 \:  \text{ in } \Omega_f, \label{eq:stokes_1}\\
    \nabla \cdot \bm{u} &=& 0 \: \text{ in } \Omega_f, \label{eq:stokes_2} \\
    \bm{u} &=& \bm{f} \:  \text{ on } \partial \Omega_f\setminus\partial B, \label{eq:stokes_3}
    \f}

    where : \f$\bm{u}\f$ is the velocity of the fluid,
    \f$\bm{D(u)} =  \dfrac{\nabla \bm{u} + \nabla \bm{u}^T}{2}\f$
    the deformation tensor, \f$p\f$ is the pressure of the fluid and
    \f$\bm{f}\f$ is a given function related to the boundary conditions on
    \f$\partial\Omega\f$ (those on \f$\partial B\f$ will be treated later by
    penalty). Moreover, we impose that the mean of the pressure is zero by adding a
    Lagrange multiplier \f$\lambda\f$. This approach allows us to use direct solvers
    such as UMFPack, MUMPS or PASTIX otherwise only iterative solvers would have
    been accessible. Thus, the variational formulation reads :

    Find \f$(\bm{u}, p, \lambda) \in H^1(\Omega_f)^2\times L^2_0(\Omega_f)\times\mathbb{R}\f$
    such that \f$\forall (\bm{v}, q, \mu) \in H^1(\Omega_f)^2\times L^2_0(\Omega_f)\times\mathbb{R}\f$ :

    \f{eqnarray}
    2 \nu \int_{\Omega_f} \bm{D(u)} : \bm{D(v)} - \int_{\Omega_f} p \nabla \cdot
    \bm{v} &&\nonumber\\
    + \int_{\Omega_f} \lambda q &=& 0, \label{eq:varstokes_1}\\
    \int_{\Omega_f} q \nabla \cdot \bm{u} &=& 0, \label{eq:varstokes_2} \\
    \int_{\Omega_f} \mu p &=& 0, \label{eq:varstokes_4}\\
    \bm{u} &=& \bm{f} \: \text{ on } \partial \Omega. \label{eq:varstokes_3}\nonumber
    \f}


    and the corresponding \Feel code is given by the listing \ref{listing_stokes}.

    The particle is taken into account following \cite Janela2005 in
    which, one imposes a rigid-body constraint by a penalty
    method. From the physics point of view, this method consists to
    consider the particle as a part of the fluid with a ``huge
    viscosity'' and constrained to have a rigid-body motion. Thus,
    instead of integrating in the fluid domain \f$\Omega_f\f$, we
    rewrite our variational formulation in the whole domain
    \f$\Omega\f$ while taking into account the following constraint

    \f[
    \bm{D(u)} = 0, \: \text{ in } B.
    \label{eq:rigidbody}
    \f]


    This rigid-body constraint \eqref{eq:rigidbody} is added to equation
    \eqref{eq:varstokes_1} using a small enough penalty coefficient
    \f$\varepsilon\f$.  Finally the new variational formulation reads

    Find \f$(\bm{u},p, \lambda) \in H^1(\Omega)^2 \times L^2_0(\Omega) \times \mathbb{R}\f$ such
    that \f$\forall (\bm{v}, q, \mu) \in H^1(\Omega)^2 \times L^2_0(\Omega) \times \mathbb{R}\f$ :

    \f{eqnarray}{
    2 \nu \int_{\Omega} \bm{D(u)} : \bm{D(v)} - \int_{\Omega} p \nabla \cdot \bm{v} && \nonumber\\
    +\int_{\Omega} \lambda q + \frac{2}{\varepsilon} \int_B \chi ( \bm{D(u)} : \bm{D(v)} )  &=& 0, \label{eq:varstokespenal_1}\\
    \int_{\Omega} q \nabla \cdot \bm{u} &=& 0, \label{eq:varstokespenal_2} \\
    \int_{\Omega} \mu p &=& 0, \label{eq:varstokespenal_4}\\
    \bm{u} &=& \bm{f} \: \text{ on } \partial \Omega. \label{eq:varstokespenal_3}\nonumber
    \f}





    Note that the integral over \f$B\f$ is performed by integrating over \f$\Omega\f$ while
    multiplying by the characteristic function \f$\chi\f$ (see listing
    \ref{listing_penalty}). In practice, only the penalty term changes during time
    and has to be reassembled (e.g. the last term in equation
    \eqref{eq:varstokespenal_1}). Thus, only the penalty term is added to the whole
    problem at each iteration. Moreover, this term does vanishes on most
    elements of the mesh and instead of integrating the penalty term over all the
    elements and multiplying by \f$\chi\f$, we only integrate on those crossed by
    \f$\chi\f$ using a special feature \c broken() of \c integrate()
    to localize these elements, see section~\ref Integrals.


    Finally, we introduce the time step \f$\Delta t\f$ and we denote by
    \f$(\bm{u}_n,p_n,\lambda_n)\f$ the solution of the system
    \eqref{eq:varstokespenal_1}-\eqref{eq:varstokespenal_2}-\eqref{eq:varstokespenal_4}
    at time \f$t_n=n\Delta t\f$.  The velocity of the particle denoted by
    \f$\bm{V}_n\f$ is then calculated by
    the relation \eqref{eq:velocitypart} and its position \f$\bm{X}_n\f$ by the relation
    \eqref{eq:positionpart}.

    \f{eqnarray}{
    \bm{V}_n &=& \frac{1}{\int_{\Omega} \chi} \int_{\Omega} \chi \, \bm{u}_n, \label{eq:velocitypart}\\
    \bm{X}_{n+1} &=& \bm{X}_{n} + \Delta t \bm{V}_n, \label{eq:positionpart}
    \f}
