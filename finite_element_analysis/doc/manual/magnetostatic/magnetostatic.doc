  This example solve the magnetostatic equation.

  \section MagnetostaticFormulation Equations

  The starting point is the Maxwell set of equation, that read :
  \f[
  \nabla \cdot D = \rho_v \\
  \nabla \cdot B = 0 \\
  \nabla \times E = - \partial_t B \\
  \nabla \times H = \partial_t D + J 
  \f]

  As long as we are in the static configuration, and we are interested in the magnetic flux, we have :
  \f[
  \nabla \cdot B = 0 \\
  \nabla \times H = J
  \f]

  \subsection StateLaw State
  The relation betweens H and B reads :
  \f[
  B = \mu_0 \mu_r H \\
  = \mu\left(A\right) H
  \f]

  \subsection Gauge Potential Vector and Coulomb Gauge
  The unknown will be the so called potential vector that is 
  \f[
  H = \nabla \times u
  \f]
  As long as the definition of u is not unique, we impose moreover to have :
  \f[
  \nabla \cdot u = 0
  \f]

  \subsection BC Boundary conditions 
  \f[
  B \cdot \vec{n} = u_d 
  \f]
  that reads
  \f[
  n \times u = u_d 
  \f]

  \subsection pb Formulation
  \f[
  \nabla \mu\left(A\right)^{-1}\times \nabla \times u = J \\
  \nabla \cdot u = 0 \\
  B \cdot \vec{n} = u_d 
  \f]

  \subsection stab Stabilized formulation
  Denote \f$\Omega \in \R^2\f$  the computational domain and \f$u\f$ the electric field solution of the following equation
  \f[
  -\nabla \mu\left(A\right)^{-1} \times \nabla \times u + c u  = J \\
  u \times n = u_d
